"Review website for Women to Travel Safely ($5M ARR opp)","Women can’t travel solo without constant anxiety. 84% of solo female travelers report feeling unsafe during their trips, yet they have no reliable way to get basic safety answers. Planning a weekend in Mexico City means scrolling through months-old Reddit threads asking “Is this neighborhood safe at night?” and getting replies from male backpackers who have no clue what women actually face. Existing platforms like TripAdvisor and Booking.com don’t capture harassment frequency, walking safety after dark, or whether that “charming neighborhood café” turns sketchy at sunset. Women end up overpaying for tourist zones or missing amazing experiences or not even traveling. That has to end. Do what Pieter Levels did for nomads.com and hoodmaps.com.
